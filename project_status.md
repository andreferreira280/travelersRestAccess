- [x] Feature plan created - see `docs/feature-plan.md`
- [x] Basic mod framework (Phase 2) - builds successfully, DLL auto-copied to game's Mods folder
- [x] Verified in-game: "TravellersRestAccess loaded" announced via NVDA

## Current Focus

- **Active feature:** Main Menu + Options (feature-plan.md items 2 and the
  "Settings/Options" rough feature) - see
  `docs/modules/main-menu-and-options.md` for full details on what's
  implemented, how it works, and open questions.
- **Branch:** `feature/mainMenu` (tracks `origin/feature/mainMenu`).
- **Live test loop:** see `novo_pedido.txt` at project root for the latest
  round of test feedback and next steps - rewritten after every test round.
- Commit only when the user explicitly says a version is ready to commit.

## Module Docs

- `docs/modules/main-menu-and-options.md` - Title Screen, "Jogar"/SaveUI,
  Options (all 4 tabs). Read this before touching `KeyboardUINavigator.cs`,
  `MenuAnnouncer.cs`, or `UITextExtractor.cs`.
- (Add one file per feature/module here as new ones start, e.g.
  `docs/modules/tutorial.md`, `docs/modules/inventory.md`.)

## Original Setup Next Steps (completed, kept for history)

1. Read `docs/ACCESSIBILITY_MODDING_GUIDE.md` completely
2. Run codebase analysis (Phase 1 in `docs/setup-guide.md`): namespaces, singletons, input system, UI system, game mechanics, tutorial
3. Document findings in `docs/game-api.md`
4. Create feature plan (Phase 1.5)
5. Set up basic C# project (Phase 2) - first goal: mod loads and announces "Mod loaded" via Tolk/NVDA
